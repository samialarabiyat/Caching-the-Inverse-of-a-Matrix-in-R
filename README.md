# Caching-the-Inverse-of-a-Matrix-in-R
Matrix inversion is computationally expensive, and repeatedly computing the inverse of the same matrix is inefficient. To optimize performance, we can cache the inverse of a matrix instead of recalculating it every time. This project implements a pair of functions in R to achieve this caching mechanism.
